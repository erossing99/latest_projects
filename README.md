# latest_projects

These are websites that I have programmed during my senior year of college.

### project_1 details:

During this project I was working to create my first full stack web application.
This website had to include functionality to collect responses to a survey and
send these responses to a postgres database for storage. This website was then
ported to Heroku for cloud hosting. The focus of this assignment was functionality
so the design of the website was not a major focus. Given extra time to work there
are many improvments to the UI I would like to make.

Tools utilized:
- flask framework
- postgres sql database
- Heroku
- PureCSS

### project_2 details:

This is a project I am currently in the process of developing. This is supposed
to be a full fledged interactive website that includes all the major functionality
that modern websites have. This includes a secure login system, posting capabilty,
post view capability, account creation, and database connection. For my project,
I decided to make a platform where users could post covers of content they enjoy
(movies, books, albums) and then an a color palette would be produced for those
images to represent the most common colors in the photos. This website will eventually
be ported to Heroku for cloud hosting. This project is a work in progress and much of
the upcoming functionality and UI design will be introduced in the coming weeks.

Tools utilized:
- flask framework
- postgres sql database
