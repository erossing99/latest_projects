# latest_projects

These are websites that I have programmed during my senior year of college.

###project_1 details:

During this project I was working to create my first full stack web application.
This website had to include functionality to collect responses to a survey and
send these responses to a postgres database for storage. This website was then
ported to Heroku for cloud hosting.

Tools utilized:
- flask framework
- postgres sql database
- Heroku

###project_2 details:

This is a project I am currently in the process of developing. This is supposed
to be a full fledged interactive website that includes all the major functionality
that modern websites have. This includes a secure login system, posting capabilty,
post view capability, account creation, and database connection. For my project,
I decided to make a platform where users could post covers of content they enjoy
(movies, books, albums) and then an a color palette would be produced for those
images to represent the most common colors in the photos. This website will eventually
be ported to Heroku for cloud hosting.

Tools utilized:
- flask framework
- postgres sql database
- auth0 security
- ColorThief (credit to Lokesh Dhakar)
- Heroku
